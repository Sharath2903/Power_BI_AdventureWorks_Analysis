# AdventureWorks - Bike Store Sales Analysis with Power BI (Personal Project)

Adventure Works is a bike manufacturer and seller and in this project I analyze their sales and returns data using Microsoft Power BI Desktop. This was an end to end project beginning with importing and data cleaning and ending with the creation of visuals and optimization of those visuals.
